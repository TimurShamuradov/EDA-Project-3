# EDA: Project 3 - Hotel Rating Prediction

## Description

This Notebook contains the code and analysis for Project 3. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model.

## Contents

- Data Exploration: In this section, we explore the dataset and gain insights into the variables and their relationships.
- Data Preprocessing: This section focuses on cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
- Feature Engineering: Here, we create new features or transform existing ones to improve the performance of the model.
- Model Building: We build and train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
- Model Evaluation: This section evaluates the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.
- Feature Importance Analysis: We analyze the importance of different features in predicting the target variable.
- Making Predictions: Using the trained model, we make predictions on new data.
- Creating Submission File: Finally, we prepare the submission file in the required format.
